# HIDE
 
Implementation of HIDE as proposed in VÃ¶lkl et al (2025), HIDE: Hierarchical cell-type Deconvolution, https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaf179

## Tutorial
In Tutorial.ipynb you find a detailed tutorial on how to use HIDE on an example breast cancer data set downloaded from DISCO (https://www.immunesinglecell.org/cell_type). HIDE_example.py also features the same example as how it could be used to integrate it into your pipeline.

## Requirements
All necessary requirements are frozen in requirements.txt. We recommend python version 3.9.6, as this was the version we used for development.

## Bugs, Issues, Correspondence
