HIDE (Hierarchical cell-type Deconvolution) is a computational approach on infering cellular distribution from bulk transcriptomic data. In comparison to other algorithms HIDE incorporates a hierarchical cell-type structure. For a detailed description of its advantages, we refer to our paper (Preprint: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.01.31.634483v1)

## Tutorial
In Tutorial.ipynb you find a detailed tutorial on how to use HIDE on an example breast cancer data set downloaded from DISCO (https://www.immunesinglecell.org/cell_type). HIDE_example.py also features the same example as how it could be used to integrate it into your pipeline.

## Requirements
All necessary requirements are frozen in requirements.txt. We recommend python version 3.9.6, as this was the version we used for development.

## Further algorithms
If you are looking for other deconvolution algorithms without the need of a hierarchical cell type structure, we recommend you to explore the DeconomiX package (http://deconomix.bioinf.med.uni-goettingen.de)
